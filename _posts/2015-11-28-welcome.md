I'm just your average guy. I like anime, computers, The Legend of Zelda, programming, Monty Python, and more...you have to meet me in person to find out more on that. :> I like anything that's funny, as long as its still in good taste.

This will be a site for my personal blogging needs, if I even have any, and to be a place where I can freely post custom content as a personal website.
